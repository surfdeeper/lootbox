Run the battle-focused bot testing system to test battle mechanics.

## Instructions

1. Run the battle bot tests using: `npx tsx src/bot-test.ts 5 2000 --battle-mode`

2. After the tests complete, provide:
   - A summary of the test results (bugs found, actions performed)
   - Analysis of battle performance (win rates, wave progression, streak stats)

3. Based on the bot's battle-heavy gameplay, analyze:
   - Battle balance (are enemies too easy/hard at different waves?)
   - Reward scaling (are battle rewards worthwhile?)
   - Weapon/armor/shield effectiveness
   - Streak system impact

4. Format your response with clear sections for:
   - Test Results Summary
   - Battle Performance Analysis
   - Balance Observations
